- Created a SQLite database `sales_data.db`
- Added a table `sales` with fields: `product`, `quantity`, `price`
- Inserted multiple product entries with quantities and prices
- Used SQL to:
  - Get **total quantity sold** and **revenue per product**
  - Identify **top-selling product**
  - Calculate **average price per product**
  - Display **total revenue**
- Used matplotlib to plot:
  - Bar chart of **revenue by product**

## üîé SQL Queries Used
```sql
-- Total revenue and quantity per product
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_qty, SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;

-- Total revenue
SELECT SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue FROM sales;

-- Top-selling product
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Average price per product
SELECT product, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;
